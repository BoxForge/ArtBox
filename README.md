# ArtBox

ArtBox is an ambitious vision to create the ultimate graphical tool for artists, particularly focused on organizing, browsing, and editing sprite collections seamlessly. The goal of ArtBox is to empower indie game developers, hobbyists, and artists with an accessible, all-in-one tool that brings simplicity and efficiency to pixel art workflows.

## Vision
ArtBox aims to become a key part of every artist's creative process by offering:
- **A Unified Workspace**: All your sprite assets in one place, with a focus on ease of navigation and management.
- **Flexible Tools**: A variety of powerful tools that cater to sprite editing, color palette management, and metadata organization, designed to work intuitively.
- **Artist-Centric Design**: ArtBox emphasizes simplicity, focusing on helping artists stay in their creative flow without overwhelming technical complexity.
- **Inter-Operable Boxes**: ArtBox is one of several planned tools that will work together to form a complete creative suite. The different "Boxes" (ArtBox, GameBox, TestBox, ToolBox, etc.) are designed to be interoperable, each handling a specific aspect of the creative process, but able to seamlessly interact with one another. For example, ArtBox can be used to create sprite assets, which can then be directly integrated into GameBox for use in level design.

## Planned Features
- **Sprite Library**: Browse through your sprite collection with a visually organized thumbnail view.
- **Metadata Management**: View and edit details of your sprites, including tags, dimensions, color palettes, and more.
- **Integrated Tools**: Seamlessly switch between tools for pixel transformation, tileset management, color adjustments, and more.
- **Customizable Workflow**: Adapt the interface and available tools to best suit your artistic needs.

## Project Status
ArtBox is currently in its early development stages, and many of the features are being conceptualized and planned. We are building a strong foundation and exploring various workflows that best fit the vision of the project.
